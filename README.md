# Domain Ontology for Microscopy (DOM)
A domain ontology for microscopy that has a special focus on Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Light Microscopy.

This ontology builds on CHAMEO, and extends the following branches with specialised classes for microscopy:
- characterisation processes
- sample preparation processes
- image processing processes
- measurement results
